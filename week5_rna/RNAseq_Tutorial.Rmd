###### (1) Set Up

Set your working environment to analysis_data:

```{r setup}
    knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("/PATH/TO/analysis_data")) 
```

Load in any necessary packages:

```{r}
# load in packages
```

Read in your data files using read.csv(). If row.names was equal to TRUE when you were writing the files, header will also be equal to TRUE (and vise versa).

```{r}
rna_clinical <-
rna_counts <-
rna_genes <-
```

###### (2) Cleaning up your data frames

```{r}

```
